# Fitness - App UML Design

This project focuses on the UML design for a fitness - related application. It includes detailed class diagrams, descriptions of classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive UML design for a fitness application. The application aims to help users manage their fitness activities, such as tracking training and diet records, generating personalized plans, interacting in a fitness community, and receiving reminders. The UML design serves as a blueprint for the development of the application, ensuring a clear understanding of the system's structure and functionality.

## Class Diagrams
The UML class diagrams of this project provide a detailed illustration of each class in the system, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between classes. The class diagram images and relevant links are included in the uploaded document. You can obtain the specific class diagram information by reviewing that document. This will help you have a more intuitive understanding of the structural and functional design of the system.
